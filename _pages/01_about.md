## About me

My name is Joel Klassen. I am a researcher in the field of quantum information.

I am currently employed as a quantum software researcher at [Phasecraft](https://www.phasecraft.io/) in London.

I grew up in Vancouver, Canada, and received my PhD in 2017 from the University of Guelph and the Institute for Quantum Computing. 

The most important things to me are empathy, honesty, and kindness.

### Research

My research interests include:
* Many Body Quantum Systems and Local Hamiltonians
* Fermionic Encodings and Fermionic Quantum Information
* The Quantum Marginal Problem
* Quantum Monte Carlo Methods
* The Geometry of Quantum States
* Hamiltonian Complexity Theory
* Quantum Foundations and Philosophy of Science

The primary philosophy motivating my research is the interplay between epistemology and ontology. In particular I am interested in how the local structure of nature informs what we can know, and how that shapes what we believe the world is. I also like solving fun math problems.

### Hobbies

I like to make visually appealing and interactive things. I have some latent artistic talent which manifests itself on a semi-regular basis. Lately I have been spending my free time making games. I like how challenging and interdisciplinary they are.
