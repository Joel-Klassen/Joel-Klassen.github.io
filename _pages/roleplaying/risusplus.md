## Introduction

This is a homebrew roleplaying system built upon the [risus rpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/170294/Risus-The-Anything-RPG). Risus is a light-weight roleplaying system designed mostly for comedy roleplaying. Its lightweight form makes it much easier for a DM to improvise, which is my preferred style, but the mechanics can become a bit samey over time. So I want to beef it up with mechanics that bring more tactical decision making to the players but preserve the flexibility, generality, and simplicity of the original rule-set. 

One of the things that make combat samey is that the decisions the player makes when they engage in combat are always basically the same: "what cliche do I use in this situation". Once they have decided on a cliche, then they roll their dice and roleplay the situation until the dice are expended and the combat concludes -- perhaps they call on help from other players or perhaps they chose to use a different cliche, but mechanically this is fairly dull. Of course the response is that the fun is in the roleplaying but if the mechanics begin to get stale then people lose motivation to roleplay I find.

## Proposed Solution

My proposed solution to this is to add an additional general mechanical element to combat -- inpired by the roleplaying system Burning Wheel -- which I'm calling a "stance". Stances are adverbs that describe how you approach combat. For example a barbarian can charge into battle "aggresively", or a politician can argue for his policies "boastfully". The mechanical effect of the stance must ultimately take the form of a risk/reward payoff. The most obvious risk/reward payoff in any game is short term vs long term gain. So for example an aggressive stance may increase the fury of your combat (bonus to rolls) but at the expense of higher risk of injury -- in the short term you improve your rolls, but in the long term you may not be able to fight so well. Modifying short term risk/reward within the existing combat system is straightforward, but in order to have more mechanical control over long term risk/reward I feel an additional mechanical element needs to be introduced that modifies the injury system and introduces a reward based counterpart to injuries.

My proposal for modifying the injury system is to do away with the semi-permanent loss of dice in a specific cliche, and instead have injuries accumulate as a new cliche. So for example, if your body is injured, then you get a new injury cliche called "wound", with some number of dice corresponding to the severity of the accumulated injury. The injury acts as a character in the game, with its own cliche "wound" -- and ideally leverages as many of the game mechanics associated with NPC cliches as we can make work! To give some flavour for how this way of thinking works let me give some flavourfull examples:

    when you are in combat with an enemy and you have an injury, if the injury has an appropriate cliche to the combat, then the injury is going to help your enemy
    
    an injury can actively try to subvert your goals. For example a mortal wound may occasionally try to kill you or a bruised ego may try to prevent you from calling your ex-wife

    curing an injury requires an appropriate cliche and occurs as combat -- ie a doctor tries to heal a wound by fighting the wound

    time heals all injuries -- but injuries may leave scars, which are usually pretty cool

Injuries constitute risk, but there must also be long term reward. And these take the form of boons. A boon may be something like a monetary reward, reputation in some social group, bought time to complete a task etc. Boons are also characters in the game. In the situation to which their cliche is appropriate, they may be called on to help you in a task or combat. Furthermore they may have some agency out in the world. A person with lots of money may attract investors without trying. However if you abuse your boon -- for example by flaunting your wealth -- it may attract thieves instead.

I intend to cook up some example stances with their associated risks and rewards. But the players and GM may suggest new stances on the fly as long as a risk and reward are established before combat. However once a stance has been invented you should do your best to respect precedent and keep it functioning the same way from then on.

Given the importance of "helping" in boons and injuries, I feel the helping mechanics need careful consideration. In the original rules PCs or NPCs may form a team. All of the leader's dice count, but only the 6s count from the other team members. Whenever a team loses a round of combat, a single team member loses a dice (determined by a roll against the cliche they are using) or a single team member volunteers to have two dice removed and then the leader gets to roll twice as many dice. In principle I see no reason why this should change for boons and injuries. Except here a boon will always volunteer to take a hit, only loses one dice instead of two, and there's no doubling for the player, and lost dice are lost permanently. Meanwhile an injury will never take a loss on dice when helping an enemy. This reflect the fact that boons can be spent but injuries cannot.

## Fidly Bits

Combat has stakes, which are the ultimate consequence of winning/losing the combat, as well as side-effects, which are the accrued injuries and boons accumulated regardless of the outcome. These should be lain out before combat starts.

Injuries and boons constitute risk and reward respectively -- however their absence can also constitute the inverse. For example if someone takes a defensive stance, their reward is that they may have reduced fighting capability, but avoid the risk of being wounded. 

In normal risus rules, losing a dice means taking an appropriate injury. In order to be able to tune the risk of taking an injury -- so that for example a cautious stance decreases the risk of injury while an aggressive stance increases the risk of injury -- we need to modify this rule as well. Instead, what I propose is that if you take a dice from your pool, then you roll it to see if you acrue an injury for it. Under normal circumstances 4,5,6 means yes and 1,2,3 means no. Stances can give plus or minuses to that roll. 

One thing I have noticed is that player characters have a tendency to forget about their injuries. As such it makes sense for the GM to keep track of injuries and players to keep track of boons. The player can call on the boons for help when appropriate, and the GM can call on injuries for help when appropriate.

Injuries accrued *during* a combat are not able to participate in that particular combat -- their participation is already reflected in the character losing dice.

## Extra Mechanics

The "stance" mechanic is a general mechanic for making combat more interesting, and is not specific to the idiosyncracies of any given character. Anyone may take a stance. That being said, it would be nice if combat also included a mechanical element which reflected the particular flavour of the player's character. For example in D&D the choice of class has particular effects on the combat mechanics, beyond just modifying the amount of damage you do. For example a rogue wants to attack stealthily while a barbarian wants to be aggressive. 

This naturally suggests that when building a player character you may want to specify what kind of stances this character favours, and this should be reflected in a mechanical bonus when using that stance. The simplest way to do this is to give the characater an advantage to rolls when using the stance. Every cliche the PC has may be decorated with a preferred stance.

Furthermore, sometimes you want your character to just have a one-off power that just makes them super special. Here I propose that at character creation a player may spend a cliche point on a "feat" -- which is a call-on ability that may be spent once per session that instantly succeeds at a task appropriate to one of their cliches, for example a thief may have the feat *Uncanny Lockpicking* wherein they may instantly open a lock without having to roll against the difficulty check. This would be subject to the approval of the GM

Also sometimes you want your character to be just a little bit extra. Here I propose the player may spend a cliche point on an "attribute" -- this is a noteworthy attribute, something you're born with, that may be called upon for +1 (or maybe +2) advantage in the appropriate situation. For example "nimble", "brainy" or "massive".

Finally, I find that the way dice rolling works means that you often get a spiral effect, where if you lose in the first roll, then you lose the rest of them because you're down dice. My proposed solution to this is for each combatant to roll, but for the combatant with the larger pool of dice to only take the top X dice, where X is the number of dice in their opponents pool. This smooths out the variability a bit.

## Example Stances

Aggressively -- +1 in opposed rolls, but -1  in injury rolls
Defensively -- -1 in opposed rolls, but +1 in injury rolls
Stealthily -- +1d6 in opposed rolls until your first lost dice, then -1 on opposed rolls from then on.
Craftily -- -1d6 in opposed rolls until your first win, then +2 from then on.
Boastfully -- -1 in opposed rolls, +1d6 reputation boon on victory
Viciously --  -1 in opposed rolls, but opponent gets -1 on injury rolls
Selfishly -- (may only be invoked in team combat) only teammates may take injuries, 1d6 reputation injury
Selflessly -- (may only be invoked in team combat) only the leader may take injuries, 1d6 reputation boon
Unscrupulously -- +1 in opposed rolls, automatic 1d6 reputation injury
Mercifully -- opponent suffers no injuries, +1d6 reputation boon on victory
Menacingly --
