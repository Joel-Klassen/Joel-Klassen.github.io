<details><summary>A Brief History of the Emerald Valley</summary>
<p><i>It has been 632 years since the dissolution of the Dominion of Ko. For nearly two millenia Ko's rule over the local stellar cluster known as the Emerald Valley, and it's hundreds of habitable planets, was unshakable, despite the frequent ambitions of upstart warlords. During this time of peace and propserity Ko pursued all manner of ambitious projects across their empire. The purposes and scope of many of these projects to this day remain a mystery to historians. Then, in a span of time as short as Ko's rule was long, the Dominion collapsed. In the wake of this collapse came 300 years of warfare between local rulers, during which time the social and technological infrastructure that sustained the Dominion dissolved and the knowledge of it's workings was lost.</i> </p>

<p><i>Now the Emerald Valley is shattered into a patchwork of feudal kingdoms and planet states, all vying for the remnants of a long dead empire. Wars between kingdoms is common, and the stars are full of roaming sell-ships, noble and villiannous, searching for a great King to swear their allegiance to, or from whom to extract a hefty fee. Many once prosperous systems are now long abandoned, whiped out by some forgotten implement of war. Scholars and scavengers scour these husks in search of clues to the past, and profitable loot. Rumors of strange horrors and impending doom steadily flow into the Emerald Valley from it's vast periphery, and nobody is sure when the next plague or foreign invader will once again dissolve the current order of things. It is a time of great uncertainty and provincialism.</i></p>

<p><i>Our protagonists find themselves in the Kingdom of Ambersol, a fairly peaceful Kingdom, with an even headed ruler. There they toil in a penal colony on an untamed and dangerous planet. Their crimes are their own, but their punishment is shared. Their future is as uncertain as that of the Emerald Valley.</i> </p>
