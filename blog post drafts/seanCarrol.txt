Sean Carrol has a podcast called Mindscape (you can find it here: ) which I enjoy listening to. I like Sean Carrol because he is a physicist and science popularizer who thinks philosophy is important and tries to engage seriously with it. This is in contrast to many other public facing physicists and science popularizers like Stephen Hawking, Steven Weinberg, Niel Degrass Tyson, Lawrence Krauss, who have all publicly disparaged philosophy as a field at some point or another. I have noticed this disdain also manifesting in the opinions of my colleagues from time to time. I think some other time I would like to talk more about this. The point is that Sean Carrol will often host philosophers on the Mindscape podcast. His most recent guest was Philip Goff who is a philosopher of consciousness from Durham University. On the show, Goff advocated for the idea of panpsychism. 

Panpsychism aims to explain why we experience consciousness. It does this by claiming that consciousness is the fundamental constituent of reality, and is identical to matter. The way that sentence is phrased is important. The claim is not that matter has consciousness as an additional property. Matter is consciousness, not "matter is conscious". The argument then goes that while materialist science describes what matter *does*, panpsychism posits what matter *is*. In this framework the answer to the question why do we, material objects, experience consciousness, is obvious, since material is consciousness.

Many physicists instinctively rankle at this idea. Sean Carrol clearly disagreed with panpsychism on the podcast. Also, during the writing of this post, I discovered that Sabine Hossenfelder also has problems with panpsychism, and also argues directl against Goffs work. I think the instinct to disagree with panpsychism is correct, however I haven't been totally convinced by the arguments I have seen. So I felt like presenting my own disagreements with it.

I am actually sympathetic to the idea of panpsychism, mostly because it was once my preferred theory of consciousness. I was introduced to the idea during my undergraduate studies when I took some cognitive science and philosophy of mind courses. My intuition in favour of panpsychysm went as follows. 

Consider the functionalist stance towards consciousness. Roughly speaking functionalism is the position that mental states are products of the processing of information and not of the physical equipment doing the processing. Thus a functionalist stance claims that the consciousness of a brain should be the same as the consciousness of a computer simulating the same brain via an algorithm, or even simulating the relevant brain processes. Suppose you accept the functionalist position. Now the question becomes, what is the dividing line between those algorithms that are conscious and those algorithms that are not? Additionally consider the fact that the content of conscious experience is different depending on the kind of information being processed. So at least among some algorithms which manifest consciousness, any difference between them is going to result in a difference in the content of consciousness, and not in the presence of consciousness itself. The answer to the earlier question, about the location of the dividing line, then readily suggests itself. What if there is no dividing line between those algorithms that are conscious, and those that are not. What if instead the difference is only in the content of what those algorithms experience? The final step to panpsychism is to recognize that everything found in nature is performing a computation in some sense. Wether it is a flock of birds, an economy, or an atom. So if one accepts that computations correspond to experiences, then experiences are everywhere.

I should emphasize that this is an explanation for my intuition when I was first leaning towards panpsychism, and is not meant to be a convincing argument in favour of panpsychism. I should also qualify all of this by saying that there are many flavours of panpsychism, with the unifying feature being that consciousness is ubiquitous. The intuition I outlined above does not make any metaphysical commitments to why the processing of information always gives rise to consciousness. Based on my limited understanding, I think there are at least three camps. First there is Goffs position, which is a kind of monist position, in which matter and consciousness are one thing. If one were to inject that perspective into the  argument I outlined above, one might say that embodied algorithmic processes and consciousness are identical. Secondly there is a dualist position, which is that there is an extra metaphysical thing which embodies consciousness, like a spirit, experiencing and effecting the behaviour of the material world. There are strong scientific reasons to reject this idea, for example if the spirit has agency over the material world then we should expect to see violations of conservation laws. There is a third position which is a more subtle form of dualism, called epiphenomenalism, which claims that there is a spirit, but it is passive, only recieving information about the world. This is more immune from some of the scientific attacks. However in her blog post, Hossenfelder raises an important point about the role that quantum theory has to play in this. According to quantum theory the behaviour of systems is not merely dictated by their interactions, but also by their degrees of freedom. If one counts this extra metaphysical stuff as a degree of freedom, then it should have an impact on the outcome of experiments, even if it does not interact directly with the systems under inspection. This an amazing fact about quantum theory that is not very widely appreciated! At least at a first glance this suggests that Goffs position is the one most compatible with observation, and so I will be focusing on this one.

 So why did I change my mind? The reasoning that convinced me to abandon panpsychism goes as follows. When I say that I am conscious, I want what I say to be true. How do I connect the truth of what I say to the fact that I experience consciousness? Consider that the statement “I am conscious” is physical matter behaving in a particular way. The story of how the statement came to be is a story about what matter *does*, not what matter *is*. If consciousness is 

 Unless what matter *is* has a bearing on what it *does*, then what matter *is* can not be responsible for the existence of the statement “I am conscious”. Consequently, if consciousness is what matter *is*, then neither can consciousness be responsible for the existence of the statement. How then could the statement be true, if it were not at all informed by the fact that I am conscious? 

In some ways this is an inversion of the zombie argument. In the zombie argument, one imagines a zombie whose statement “I am conscious” is untrue, thus casting doubt on materialism. In the inverted argument, one demands the truth of their own statement “I am conscious”, and consequently demands a scientific materialist account of the relation between the mental and the physical. It is especially convenient rhetorically, because many philosophers of mind who feel the problem can not be resolved by a scientific maetrialist account really like to claim they are conscious.

This argument can obviously be generalized. Statements are what matter *does*, and so statements are meaninfully true only by virtue of what matter *does*! More formally:
	- All statements are instantiated as the behaviour of physical material (whatever that happens to be).
	- Scientific materialism can in principal *completely account* for the *behaviour* of physical material. <- modulo the existence of physical material
	(rephrase: save for the existence of physical material, scientific materialsim can in pincipal supply a complete account of the *behaviour* of physical material)
	- Thus scientific materialism can in principal completely account for the existence of all statements.
	- If the process by which a statement is produced is unrelated to the propositional content of that statement, then the claims of the statement are unjustified. <- weakest point
	- Any proposition instantiated as a statement that is not ultimately about the behaviour of physical material is unjustified.
	(All justified propositions that are instantiated as statements are about the behaviours of physical material, and so admit a scientific materialist account.)

	Corollary:
	- I am conscious.
	- The previous proposition is justified.
	- My consciousness admits a scientific materialist account.

[difference between truth and justification: I can claim "You, the reader, are named James". It may or may not be true, but it is completely unjustified, and so conveys no information.]

 Because assertions are embodied by physical behaviour, and because all physical behaviour can only be causally accounted for by other physical behaviour  there can be no justified assertions about non-physical things!

 This seems like too strong an argument!! So where are the holes and bullets? One big assumption is that scientific materialism can account for the behaviour of physical material. However this is widely considered a fairly conservative position to take, and indeed Goff makes it very clear that he accepts this premise. What about the premise that statements are instantiated as the behavious of physical material? Well... what else might statements be made of? Perhaps there is an additional non-physical thing hitching a ride with a statement, a ghost of meaning! 

The interesting thing about this argument is that it relies on the assertion that information is wholly physical. One could reject this, and in fact I think the reason this argument is not more common is because many people haven’t full internalized, or simply don’t believe, that information is wholly physical. I call this stance “information dualism”, and I think it is an idea in need of more discussion. If anyone knows of any philosophical work dealing with this idea please let me know. I did a google search of information dualism and the only thing I could find that is in the same vein is this post on a yahoo analytic philosophy group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.analytic-philosophy/EwzE5Sk9tXo

You may have noticed that I have tried to avoid using the term “proposition” in my arguments here, and instead used the term “statement”. It is because there is an ambiguity in what the term “proposition” means that obscures my point. I think this ambiguity is an example of information dualism. Consider that a statement is indeed a physical thing. But it is not at all clear that a proposition is a physical thing. For example, two statements in different languages may represent the same proposition. Where is the extra stuff that embodies the propositional portion of the statement? Is it physical stuff?

Here is another example of information dualism which I notice sometimes in physics. Consider a particle. A common stance is that the particle has a position *and* the particle carries the information about its position. There is an extra ghost that goes along with the particle, which is the information about the particle’s properties. I contend that this is a category error, and I suspect that errors of this kind constitute a deep confusion in the physical sciences, especially in quantum theory.

[cut] I think there is also some territorialism at play. How would you feel if, in your assessment, your profession worked intensely for centuries to clearly explicate aspects of the nature of reality, and then someone came along and said "yeah that, but let's also tack on this idea I have". I am not convinced those feelings are justified, but that is beside the point. 

 [cut] This fact alone makes me a little reticent to broach this topic, for fear of attracting the denizens of her comment section. In any case I will write some summaries of what I think are Sabine's and Sean's arguments in a moment.
