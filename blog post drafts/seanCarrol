Sean Carrol has a podcast called Mindscape (you can find it here: ) which I enjoy listening to. I like Sean Carrol because he is a physicist and science popularizer who thinks philosophy is important and tries to engage seriously with it. This is in contrast to many other public facing physicists and science popularizers like Stephen Hawking, Steven Weinber, Niel Degrass Tyson, Lawrence Krauss, who have all publicly disparaged philosophy as a field at some point or another. I have noticed this disdain also manifesting in the opinions of my colleagues from time to time. I think some other time I would like to talk more about this. The point is that Sean Carrol will often host philosophers on the Mindscape podcast. His most recent guest was Philip Goff who was a philosopher of consciousness from Durham University. On the show, ---- advocated for the idea of panpsychism. 

Panpsychism aims to explain why we experience consciousness. It does this by claiming that consciousness is the fundamental constituent of reality, and is identical to matter. The way that sentence is phrased is important. The claim is not that matter has consciousness as an additional property. Matter is consciousness, not "matter is conscious". The argument then goes that while materialist science describes what matter *does*, and by extension what consciousness *does*, pansychism posits what matter *is*. In this framework the answer to the question why do we, material objects, experience consciousness, is obvious, since material is consciousness.

Many physicists instinctively rankle at this idea, and I think those instincts are correct, although I haven't seen many convincing arguments for why those instincts are correct. I think there is also some territorialism at play. How would you feel if, in your assessment, your profession worked intensly for centuries to clearly explicate aspects of the nature of reality, and then someone came along and said "yeah that, but let's also tack on this idea I have". I am not convinced those feelings are justified, but that is beside the point. Sean Carrol clearly disagreed with panpsychism on the podcast. Also, during the writing of this post, I discovered that Sabine Hossenfelder also has problems with panpsychism. This fact alone makes me a little reticent to broach this topic, for fear of attracting the denizens of her comment section. In any case I will write some summaries of what I think are Sabine's and Sean's arguments in a moment.

I am in fact quite sympathetic to the idea of panpsychism, mostly because for a period of time it was my preferred theory of consciousness. I took a number of cognitive science and philosophy of mind courses during my undergraduate studies, and it was there that I was introduced to the idea. My reasoning went as follows. 


-epiphenomenalism
- sabine: "Empty words and no explanatory power", sciences monopoly on explanation. The only explanations that mean anything are scientific explanations. No room for the notion of concept creation. The only meanings are those which we have already built for ourselves.
